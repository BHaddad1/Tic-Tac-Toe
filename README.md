# Tic-Tac-Toe...with Cats!

### Learning Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Context
- I worked on this project for five days and just began my sixth week in my first module at Turing. 

### Wins & Challenges
Some challenges included: 
    - Fixing the data model solely based on console logs.
    - Cleaning up bugs that were created in the DOM that were caused by not accessing the data model correctly in the main.js file.
Some wins included: 
    - Building out a correct data model.
    - Being able to fuly digest the concept of utilizing the data model to lead the DOM.
